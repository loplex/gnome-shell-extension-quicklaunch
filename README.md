# Description

This extension adds a popup menu to the top bar of gnome-shell.

If you have any custom launchers, for example from a previous version of gnome-panel, or from your desktop, you can use the new popup to start these.

To populate the popup menu, put .desktop files into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch/`
